Since 2016, there's existed <Ext href="https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/ternary-operator/2116">this thread</Ext>
on Kotlin Discussions with the idea to add a ternary operator to Kotlin.

If you clicked on this article, you probably know what a ternary operator is, but for
the folks who don't know what a ternary operator is, here's what it looks like in Java:

<Code language="Java" name="Ternary operator in Java">
```java
// in a function body
boolean someBoolean = false;
String s = someBoolean ? "bool is true" : "bool is false";

// equivalent to
boolean someBoolean = false;
String s;
if (someBoolean) {
    s = "bool is true";
} else {
    s = "bool is false";
}
```
</Code>

As can be seen, the ternary operator is basically a concise `if` statement but passes up values. If you want any more
information than that, you can always visit the <Ext href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_conditional_operator">Wikipedia page</Ext> 
for more.

## There is no Kotlin ternary operator

Sorry to burst your bubble, but there is no tooth fairy, there is no bigfoot, and there is no
<Ext href="https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/ternary-operator/2116/171">hope of the Kotlin ternary operator</Ext>
in the future. 

The main reason as to why it wasn't added to Kotlin was because in other languages
like Java, the `if` keyword creates a statement and not an expression where Kotlin's
`if` *does create* an expression.

The ternary statement was created to solve problems like this in Java which are less elegant to
solve without an `if` expression it but aren't necessary in Kotlin because of its `if` expression:

<Code language="Java" name="‚ùå Does not compile in Java">
```java
// in a function body
boolean hi = true;
String string = if (hi) "hi there!" else "bye there!";
//                      ^ invalid syntax!

// this isn't possible in Java! we must use a
// ternary operator to make it work!
```
</Code>

To contrast:

<Code language="Kotlin" name="‚úÖ Using an if expression in Kotlin">
```kotlin
// works just fine!
val value = if (boolean) "true" else "false"
```
</Code>

The argument that the bottom is in Kotlin is the reason they didn't add it--the ternary
simply exists to solve a problem that was present in Java (for instance).

## Not clickbait

Alright now that we've just went over *why* there isn't a ternary operator in Kotlin as well
as the fact that it will never *ever* appear in the language in the future, let's address this
article's title: *"{frontmatter.title}"* (which we'll get to in a moment! *this isn't clickbait!*).

There's actually some "valid" use cases for the ternary operator in a language with `if`s as
expressions that make sense:
- Places where it's universally understood by everyone working on it
- Allows for more concise code (possible readability increase?)

And it's for that reason we're going to just cook our own in this article.

<Code language="Kotlin" name="Expressions.kt">
```kotlin
infix fun <T : Any> Boolean.wuh(f: Pair<() -> T, () -> T>): T = 
    if (this) f.first() else f.second()

infix fun <T : Any> Boolean.wuh(v: Pair<T, T>): T = 
    if (this) v.first else v.second
```
</Code>

It can be used like so:

<Code language="Kotlin" name="wuh usage">
```kotlin
val condition = false

// ‚ùå boring if statements üôÑ
if (condition) "hello " + sqrt(2.0) else "bye bye!"
if (condition) "condition true" else "condition false"

// ‚úÖ using what we cooked
condition wuh ({ "hello " + sqrt(2.0) } to { "bye bye!" })
condition wuh ("condition true" to "condition false")
```
</Code>

## Closing Thoughts
As I hope you can now see, it's cumbersome to do something like this. It doesn't even save that
many characters (at least for the examples I used above).

Most times, it's more worth it to stick to `if` anyway since this makes it harder to debug too.

Maybe one person out there will find this and actually decide to use it, despite its flaws
and if you're that person: I hope this helps you.
