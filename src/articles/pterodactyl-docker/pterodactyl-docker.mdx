Pterodactyl's great! Unfortunately the documentation on how to install Pterodactyl is still lacking.

When I was in middle school (*in the United States*), I tried to install Pterodactyl and ended up 
having to restart at least 10 (!) times because of minor mistakes. The only installations that ended 
up working first try were the installer scripts which often harbored their own issues.

We now live in the age where you can just use Docker and Docker Compose to deploy everything easily.
It's a shame though that the 
<Ext href="https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html">official documentation</Ext>
has no Docker Compose instructions to show for it.

Enough waffling. Here's how to easily configure it.

---

Basic assumptions (if you know what you are doing, this guide is still fine):
- You have a domain and it is correctly set up to point `panel.domain.com` and `node.domain.com` to your server
- Docker is running on root (unfortunately rootless `cgroupsv2` is broken with non Systemd systems)
- Docker is running in an environment that supports `cgroupsv2` to limit container resource usage
- Firewall allows: 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 443/udp, 8080/tcp, 8080/udp, and 2022/tcp

*Why open 8080/tcp and 8080/udp when we could just use 443? Pterodactyl is rather picky and using 443 exclusively
does not play well with Caddy. It is doable though and I encourage you to give it a try if you think you've got the chops.*

In the course of the guide, you should place all the individual components in separate folders.
A file structre like the following should suffice:

<Code language="plaintext" name="File Structure">
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ panel/
‚îÇ  ‚îî üìÑ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ wings/
‚îÇ  ‚îî üìÑ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ caddy/
‚îÇ  ‚îî üìÑ docker-compose.yml
‚îÇ  ‚îî üìÑ Caddyfile
...
```
</Code>

Let's start with the easy part (the panel) first (*read the instructions!*):

<Code language="YAML" name="Panel's Docker Compose" source="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pterodactyl/panel/develop/docker-compose.example.yml">
```yaml
version: '3.8'
x-common:
  database:
    &db-environment
    # Do not remove the "&db-password" from the end of the line below, it is important
    # for Panel functionality.
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: &db-password "CHANGE_ME"
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "CHANGE_ME_TOO"
  panel:
    &panel-environment

    # !!!!!
    # CHANGE THIS
    APP_URL: "https://panel.kunet.dev"
    #
    # !!!!!

    APP_TIMEZONE: "UTC"
    APP_SERVICE_AUTHOR: "noreply@example.com"
  mail:
    &mail-environment
    MAIL_FROM: "noreply@example.com"
    MAIL_DRIVER: "smtp"
    MAIL_HOST: "mail"
    MAIL_PORT: "1025"

services:
  database:

    restart: always
    networks:
      - caddy
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
    volumes:
      - "$PWD/pterodactyl/database:/var/lib/mysql"
    environment:
      <<: *db-environment
      MYSQL_DATABASE: "panel"
      MYSQL_USER: "pterodactyl"

    restart: always
    links:

    volumes:
      - "$PWD/pterodactyl/var/:/app/var/"
      - "$PWD/pterodactyl/nginx/:/etc/nginx/http.d/"
      - "$PWD/pterodactyl/certs/:/etc/letsencrypt/"
      - "$PWD/pterodactyl/logs/:/app/storage/logs"
    environment:

      DB_PORT: "3306"
networks:
  caddy:
    external: true
    name: caddy
    driver: bridge
```
</Code>

Now:

<Code language="Bash" name="Running it up (in the panel folder)">
```bash
# magic to change the default database password to a secure random value
# (you won't need it for anything else unless you plan to reuse the database in which case you'd want to create a separate database compose file)
sed -i "s/\"CHANGE_ME\"/\"$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 < /dev/random | head -c 8)\"/" docker-compose.yml
sed -i "s/\"CHANGE_ME_TOO\"/\"$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 < /dev/random | head -c 8)\"/" docker-compose.yml

# create Caddy network
docker network create caddy --driver bridge --subnet 172.14.0.0/16

# now it's time to start it up
docker-compose up -d

# create a user for later
docker exec -it panel_panel_1 php artisan p:user:make
```
</Code>

Now, let's move on to `wings`:

<Code language="YAML" name="docker-compose.yml" source="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pterodactyl/wings/develop/docker-compose.example.yml">
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  wings:
    image: ghcr.io/pterodactyl/wings:latest
    restart: always
    networks:
      - caddy
    ports:
      - "2022:2022"
    tty: true
    environment:
      TZ: "UTC"
      WINGS_UID: 988
      WINGS_GID: 988
      WINGS_USERNAME: pterodactyl
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
      - "/var/lib/docker/containers/:/var/lib/docker/containers/"
      - "/etc/pterodactyl/:/etc/pterodactyl/"
      - "/var/lib/pterodactyl/:/var/lib/pterodactyl/"
      - "/var/log/pterodactyl/:/var/log/pterodactyl/"
      - "/tmp/pterodactyl/:/tmp/pterodactyl/"
      - "/etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs:ro"
networks:
  caddy:
    external: true
    name: caddy
    driver: bridge
```
</Code>

Don't start `wings` quite yet... we'll get back to that soon enough.

Oh, and here's the Caddy Docker Compose file:

<Code language="YAML" name="Caddy's Docker Compose">
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  caddy:
    container_name: caddy
    networks:
      - caddy
    image: caddy:alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "443:443/udp"
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8080:8080/udp"
    volumes:
      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - $PWD/caddy_data:/data
      - $PWD/caddy_config:/config
    command: "sh -c 'caddy fmt -w /etc/caddy/Caddyfile && caddy run --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile'"
networks:
  caddy:
    external: true
    name: caddy
    driver: bridge
```
</Code>

*This is an especially cool Caddy config since it automatically formats the Caddyfile on boot!*

And inside the same folder that the Caddy `docker-compose.yml` file is in is the `Caddyfile`.
Change the domains to the domains to your domains but keep the `http://panel` and `http://wings:8080`
as they are automatically correctly routed to the other containers through the magic of Docker's DNS:

<Code language="Caddyfile" name="Caddyfile">
```Caddyfile
panel.kunet.dev {
    reverse_proxy http://panel
}

node.kunet.dev:8080 {
    reverse_proxy http://wings:8080
}
```
</Code>

These commands on Linux will increase the maximum UDP buffer size, which you might want to do for <Ext href="https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Buffer-Sizes">performance reasons</Ext> for QUIC (which runs on UDP) and is enabled by default in Caddy:

<Code language="Bash" name="Increase UDP buffer size">
```bash
# needs to be run as root
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2500000
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2500000
```
</Code>

Go ahead and start up the Caddy proxy:

<Code language="Bash" name="Start Caddy (in the caddy folder)">
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
</Code>

Now log into the panel and begin the node creation process in the admin area.

You'll want to make sure the following options are in order:
- Behind Proxy (we are indeed behind a proxy)

Once it's been created, head to the configuration tab and copy it all to clipboard.

You'll want to place the contents of the file into the path `/etc/pterodactyl/config.yml`.
After that, you're free to start up `wings`.

<Code language="Bash" name="Start Wings (in the wings folder)">
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
</Code>

When you click on the side bar button for "Nodes" and see a green heart icon next to your new node,
you'll know that the configuration has correctly worked, and you can begin making servers to your heart's content.

This guide is especially finnicky and difficult, ask questions in the comments or <Ext href="https://github.com/imkunet">contact me</Ext> directly.
