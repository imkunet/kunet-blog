BGP is a cool antiquated technology that powers routing
stuff all over the internet. The basic idea is simple: a router
tells other routers that it should route traffic to a destination
based on some rules. The rules are assigned to some *prefix* or
CIDR (they are notated like `10.99.0.0/24`).

If you know about IPv4, you'll know that you can actually represent
every IPv4 address as a 32 bit integer, so a CIDR notation is literally
a *prefix* that is `n` bits long (indicated by the `/n` part).

This is pretty useful for one big thing: finding out which operators are
associated with a specific IP address. As an example, as of the time of
writing this, one of the CIDR prefixes that Cloudflare
<Ext href="https://bgp.tools/prefix/1.1.1.0/24">announces</Ext> is
`1.1.1.0/24` for their famous `1.1.1.1` DNS service.

Since the prefix's length is 24 bits, that means there is 8 bits at the
end of the address that can be changed. Because $2^8 = 256$, that means
this CIDR covers 256 addresses that being `1.1.1.0` to `1.1.1.255`.

This means if we have a list of all the published prefixes, we can take
an IP address like `1.1.1.128` and go through each prefix to see if it matches.
Eventually, we will end up finding the `1.1.1.0/24` prefix  published by
Cloudflare. With that, we can conclude that `1.1.1.128` belongs to Cloudflare.

BGP.tools provides a way to get the a visibility table with ASNs through
<Ext href="https://bgp.tools/kb/api">their API</Ext>. As of writing this,
running `cat -v table.txt | wc -l` yields 1,217,754 prefixes! That's a lot 
of prefixes but includes both IPv4 and IPv6. Filtering to just IPv4 using
`grep -v -F ':' table.txt | wc -l` gives 1,006,324. This is a perhaps more
managable number.
