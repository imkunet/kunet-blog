<Ext href="https://github.com/hanna-kn">Hanna Knutsson</Ext> has been working on a project
called <Ext href="https://qalculate.github.io/">Qalculate!</Ext> for a long time now. Hanna's
<Ext href="https://github.com/Qalculate/libqalculate/commit/ed39e97b687f629b5129f5dd675e4d7d26df3c49">initial commit</Ext>
on `libqalculate` was in 2016 and if you look at her GitHub activity, she's been working on it extremely consistently.

| *pretty much all of these are Qalculate related* |

It runs across different platforms too supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux. It can even run in the command line using the `qalc`
command interactively.

Give it a <Ext href="https://qalculate.github.io/downloads.html">download</Ext> if you intend to try it out!
Personally, I recommend using the GTK versions.

## My settings

Whenever reinstalling my system, I always flick on the following settings:
- Turn on live calculation (Mode > Calculate As You Type)
- More precision (Mode > Precision > 32)
- Digit grouping to commas (Edit > Preferences > Numbers & Operators > Digit grouping > `local`)
- Ignore commas in numbers (Edit > Preferences > Numbers & Operators > Ignore commas in numbers)
- Show keypad and history at the same time (hit the padlock next to the word Keypad in the main screen
expand history and keypad as shown in the screenshot above)

## Some capabilities

These are just some things I use Qalculate for on a day-to-day basis that I thought would be
neat to include here.

- Conversion: `100USD to HKD`, `25m/s to ft/min`, `50KiB to GB`
- Equations with `x`: `2^x=4096`, `sqrt("apple") = 2x`
- Annoying to do by hand: `mean(10; 20; 30)`, `factorize(727)`
- Bits and stuff: `2 << 10`, `("snowflake" >> 22) + 1420070400000`

## Closing Thoughts

I absolutely love this calculator and it is very clearly a work of love. It is many features and
the author is responsive in GitHub issues. It's also very capable and easy to use with 
<Ext href="https://qalculate.github.io/manual/index.html">documentation</Ext> too!
