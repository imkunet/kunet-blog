<Ext href="https://github.com/hanna-kn">Hanna Knutsson</Ext> has been working on a project
called <Ext href="https://qalculate.github.io/">Qalculate!</Ext> for a long time now. Hanna's
<Ext href="https://github.com/Qalculate/libqalculate/commit/ed39e97b687f629b5129f5dd675e4d7d26df3c49">initial commit</Ext>
on `libqalculate` was in 2016 and if you look at her GitHub activity, she's been working on it extremely consistently.

It runs across different platforms too supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux. It can even run in the command line using the `qalc`
command interactively.
