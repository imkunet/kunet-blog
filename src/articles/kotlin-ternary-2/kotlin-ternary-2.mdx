## Foreword
This article is a sequel to this article:
<RefArticleLink articleKey="kotlin-ternary" />

After posting that article I realized a better way to
make a ternary function in Kotlin... and it's rather *cursed*.

## Hurry up
Alright. Well. This is absolutely horrible. Never use
this, please.

<Code language="Kotlin" name="Cursed Ternary">
```kotlin
infix fun <T : Any> Boolean.`?`(v: T) = this to v
infix fun <T : Any> Pair<Boolean, T>.`:`(v: T) =
    if (first) second else v

// this works because it's eval'd LTR
// so "false ? true" becomes a pair and
// ": false" evaluates the ternary
val a = false `?` "true" `:` "false"
```
</Code>

This can't be that bad... right?

## It is that bad
Yeah, the thing that stands out as being the worst part is that no matter
what, the true branch will be evaluated meaning you can't use any thing that
creates a side effect as values for the branches of the ternary. You can of course
adapt the function to take in `() -> T` parameters, but I'll leave that as an
exercise to the reader :^)
