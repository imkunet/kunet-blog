## Foreword
This article is a sequel to this article:
<RefArticleLink articleKey="kotlin-ternary" />

After posting that article I realized a better way to
make a ternary function in Kotlin... and it's rather *cursed*.

## Hurry up
Alright. Well. This is absolutely horrible. Never use
this, please.

<Code language="Kotlin" name="Cursed Ternary">
```kotlin
infix fun <T : Any> Boolean.`?`(v: T) = this to v
infix fun <T : Any> Pair<Boolean, T>.`:`(v: T) =
    if (first) second else v

// this works because it's eval'd LTR
// so "false ? true" becomes a pair and
// ": false" evaluates the ternary
val a = false `?` "true" `:` "false"
```
</Code>

This can't be that bad... right?

## It is that bad
Don't get fired for using this and don't blame it on me :)
