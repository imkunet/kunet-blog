### Prologue
There's just something so elegant and human about presenting yourself in a 
certain way. Some people dress to their gender and others wear stylish clothes.
Ultimately it's all about human expression.

Some people even dress up their LinkedIn and GitHub profiles as much as they 
dress up in real life. To some degree, these are equally as valid forms of
self expression.

### Problem Space
A lot of the time I find myself sharing my SSH public key, it's for access to
a root account on some server with 5 other people's keys in the `authorized_keys`
file.

The two gripes I have are:
- Sometimes people are still using RSA, so their public key is quite long
- Having the comment just be some old gmail address is rather boring

> How can I be more creative while keeping the key short and the file clean?

### Branded `.onion` *Vanity* Addresses
For a while now, there's projects like <Ext href="https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o">mkp224o</Ext>
out there that can generate a ton of `.onion` addresses and find one that
matches a brand.

There are a few existing tools to brute force these ssh-ed25519 keys but I wanted
to try making my own.

### The First Attempt (golang)
Oh *gourd*, where do I even begin? This one is staying closed source forever and is written in
the <Ext href="https://go.dev/">Go</Ext> language.

I chose Go for these reasons:
- Automatic (easy) memory management
- Fast build times (rapid iteration)
- I know Go has high level abstractions for stuff like process launching
- Not Java

The approach was rather simple: how do we generate SSH keys? We use the command line tool, of course!

<Code language="bash" name="Key pair generation (outputs it to test and test.pub)">
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C im@kunet.dev -f test -N \"\"
```
</Code>

This would just run in a loop *ad infinitum*. No threads or *goroutines*.

As you can imagine this wasn't very fast or good.

### The Second Attempt (Rust)
Rust is a pretty cool language (and it's all the rage nowadays). *Fearless concurrency*
is cool and all and I decided it would be worth a shot.

The approach was pretty much the same and just launched 16 hardware threads each one
spawning a `ssh-keygen` process, checking its output, and then trying until it finds a match.

This approach allowed for checking around 100 keys/sec on my computer. It also used up 100% of
my CPU (*not good!*).

After writing this, I got sick and tired of being in a completely safe envrionment so
came crawling back to Zig.

### Zig (the best language)
Toying around with key generation in Rust made me feel *horrible*--relying on at least 6 crates
just to make it work and a few more if I wanted to even attempt to get Ed25519 key pair generation
working inside the app.

All the functionality (aside from the command line interface stuff) could luckily enough easily
be done through the Zig standard library despite the language being much less mature and having far
less of a userbase!

You can find the project <Ext href="https://github.com/imkunet/bruter-zig">here</Ext> and now my new
public SSH keys is:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIP8RbVheuZrUZmQv+5HvBxM0tGzo0wmK0cTZhTHKuNet im@kunet.dev
```

*just for fun!*
