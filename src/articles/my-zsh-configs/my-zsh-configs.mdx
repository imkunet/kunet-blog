import Code from '../../components/Code.astro';

Nothing big in this post, just sharing my current zsh config

<Code language="Zsh" name="~/.kushell">
```sh
# needed for this config:
# antigen
# fzf
# starship
# zsh
# git

source /usr/share/zsh/share/antigen.zsh

ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY=(history completion)

antigen use oh-my-zsh
# see https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/command-not-found to find what to install
antigen bundle command-not-found
antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
antigen bundle fzf
antigen bundle Aloxaf/fzf-tab
antigen apply

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit

export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/.kushell-starship.toml
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```
</Code>

<Code language="TOML" name="~/.kushell-starship.toml">
```toml
add_newline = false

[character]
success_symbol = '[ðŸŒ¸](green)'
error_symbol = '[âœ—](bold red)'

[line_break]
disabled = true

[nodejs]
detect_files = ['!video.ts', '!audio.ts']

[cmd_duration]
min_time=0

[zig]
symbol='îš© '
```
</Code>

(Now add this to the beginning of your .zshrc)

<Code language="Zsh" name="~/.zshrc">
```sh
# ...
source ~/.kushell
```
</Code>
